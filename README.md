# Peer-graded Assignment: Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project #

This repository is my submission for Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project. It has the instructions on how to run analysis on Human Activity Recognition dataset.

## Dataset ##
[Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)
## FIles ##
- **CodeBook.rmd** a code book that describes the variables, the data and any transformations or work that i performed to clean up the data.

- **run_analysis.R** performs the data preparation and then followed by the 5 step reqired as described in the course project's defenition:
  - Merges the trainning and the test data sets to create new data set.
  - Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
  - Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
  - Appropriately labels the data set eith descriptive variables names.
  - From the data set in step 4, create a second independent tidy data set with average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
  
- **FinalData.txt** is the exported final data sfter going through all the sequences described above.
